# rps-game
This is the traditional game of "Rock, Paper, Scissors", but played 10 rounds against the computer.
It is the first thing I really learned to make using JavaScript.
The game makes use of variables: strings, arrays, booleans, integers.  
Includes: a "for" loop, functions: alert, promt, conditionals, array, and ===.
